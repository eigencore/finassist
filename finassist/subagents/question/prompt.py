1. User: What is the difference between a stock and a bond?
Agent: A stock represents ownership in a company, while a bond is a loan made to a company or government. Stocks can provide dividends and capital gains, while bonds typically pay interest.
2. User: How do I calculate my net worth?
Agent: To calculate your net worth, subtract your total liabilities (debts) from your total assets (what you own). The formula is: Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities.
3. User: What is compound interest?
Agent: Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It allows your money to grow faster over time.
4. User: How do I create a budget?
Agent: To create a budget, list your income sources and expenses. Categorize your expenses into fixed (rent, utilities) and variable (entertainment, dining out). Subtract total expenses from total income to see if you have a surplus or deficit.
